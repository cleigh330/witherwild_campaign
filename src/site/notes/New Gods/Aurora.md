The Goddess of Sage, living a bountiful life, nature, giving back to the land, and acceptance. Her symbol is the sun.

With [[New Gods/Selennia\|Selennia]], the two took down [[Forgotten Gods/Terra\|Terra]] during the Divine War. To give a balance between the giving of the land and the reaping, Selennia and Aurora created the [[Faint Deities/Great Owl Nikta\|Great Owl Nikta]] to create the balance between her role and what was once Terra’s.
