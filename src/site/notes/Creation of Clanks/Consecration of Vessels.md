In Fanewick, clanks are wooden/stone humanoids that are inhabited by the essence of a soul. These beings are made typically by a Druid or Ranger artificer.

After their construction, a clank must be awakened by a ceremony called the Consecration of Vessels. This ceremony consists of three main parties: a Veilbinder, Vesselwarden, and Animarch. 

An Animarch is chosen and trained to usher in a “newborn” clank. They are taught by former Animarchs on how to properly teach and guide the clank on sorting through their memories of past lives and determining a purpose that will bring the lost soul its fulfillment. Animarchs form a deep connection to their clanks and are often bound together for life in a sort of guardianship.

The Vesselwarden and Veilbinder work together closely throughout the Consecration. Within the [[World Information/Core Realms\|Core Realms]], they ask the New Gods in the Hallows Above to aid them in  mediations to find a soul in need from the Valley of Death in the Cosmos. Together they work to find a worthy and willing soul. Sometimes the process is quick, but it could take days and, in rare cases, weeks. Once the soul is found, the Veilbinder inscribes the runic pattern for the soul on the clank’s body. If this clank has gone through multiple ceremonies, they would have runic symbols on various parts of their body, indicating past lives. 

Inside their chest cavity, the names of the Veilbinder and Animarch are etched. The year may also be included to indicate the age of the clank. The chest cavity holds the soul that was taken in by the wood and/or stone form. This soul glows a bright green, and light seems to dance around a stone-like orb.

Typically clanks are “born” with the lingering, though often disjointed, memories of a past life — a former spirit —and those leaders of the consecration, specifically the Animarch, aid them in understanding, accepting, and building their own path from these memories. Through the exploration of self, clanks come to a determination of a purpose that would heal the soul occupying them. For some, this is a life of service, others protection, or even a path of enlightenment. In some cases, when the soul feels fulfilled, they may depart from the clank, but others stay active within the clank until the parts of the clank cause its life cycle to end.
