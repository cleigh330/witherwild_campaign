Caelum is a wooden clank of the wildborne community in Fanewick. He is a Warden of Renewal Druid, covered in runic carvings, adorned in simple brown and green clothing, and a memory that escapes him.

Caelum’s awakening was abrupt in the middle of the Fanewick wood. Normally, in Fanewick, a clank would be awakened by a ceremony called the [[Consecration of Vessels\|Consecration of Vessels]] with a Veilbinder, Vesselwarden, and Animarch; however, Caelum was brought into the [[Mortal Realm\|Mortal Realm]] with no ceremony and none of the previously mentioned figures. Typically clanks are “born” with the lingering, though often disjointed, memories of a past life — a former spirit —and those leaders of the consecration aid them in understanding, accepting, and building their own path from these memories. Caelum was not met with any memories of a former life. Alone in the wood at an abandoned Druid circle, he was unsure of his surroundings, the world at large, or, even more importantly, his purpose. 

For his first few days, he simply walked through Fanewick, collecting rocks, admiring the growth of the nature around him, and hoping for some recollection of who he was in this world. Reaching the [[Fanewick Cities & Towns/Riverwalker’s Hunting Ground\|Riverwalker’s Hunting Ground]], he crossed paths very briefly with some giants. Amongst this group was [[PCs/Rizzha\|Rizzha]], who he would later run into again.

Continuing on his aimless wandering, he encountered a pack of animals that he thought would be friendly woodland spirits. The Witherwild, the affliction of this land, was unknown to him, and when he approached the creatures, he was dismayed and shocked to find that they were hostile. Attempting to flee from the attack but sustaining some injury, he was saved by a half-orc named [[PCs/Orielle\|Orielle]].

Orielle took him to the settlement she was staying at known as [[Fanewick Cities & Towns/The Stones of Cassema\|The Stones of Cassema]]. This camp was filled with other druids, rangers, and guardians and families that call it home. As he got to know Orielle and confided in her, she helped give him a proper name: Caelum. In return for saving him and being his friend in this confusing, new life, he gave her a protective pendant.

He was fully settled into a life here at The Stones of Cassema with Orielle, but his purpose was still a mystery. At times, this caused him distress, but he easily disguised this from those at the settlement. While happy to go along with his friend Ori on whatever adventures they found, a part of him couldn’t help but wonder about his past and his purpose.
