Willow Blackwood is a half-elf half-faerie from the highborne Blackwood family. She is four feet tall with blue skin, antennae, pink eyes, and blonde hair. With her iridescent tri-wings, she can fly easily. By her side, she is always accompanied by her harmless, fire elemental cat, NAME.

Willow’s family was part of the trade business and some rather shady dealings of enchanted weapons. The marriage of [[Therion Blackwood\|Therion Blackwood]] and [[Seraphene Thistlebloom\|Seraphene Thistlebloom]] solidified an alliance between elves and fae. Therion was a domineering elf and the mastermind of their weapon trade. Her mother worked on the weapon enchantment, happily going along with Therion’s plan that kept them wealthy and safe. The marriage culminated in four children. The eldest was [[Vaelen\|Vaelen]]. He was expected to take over operations eventually, and he was ambitious and loyal. Next was [[Elowen\|Elowen]], Willow’s sharp-tongued, roguish sister. Willow’s younger sister was [[Thistle\|Thistle]], and she was Willow’s favorite sibling. Thistle was mischievous and had a sharp-wit, and because she was still learning her magic, she was very close to Willow.

Their rival family was the Keladors, who also traded weapons to [[Haven Cities & Towns/Haven\|Haven]]. The Blackwoods did not discriminate on who they sold weaponry to, and would sell to both Havenites and, secretly, Wicklings — so long as they paid hefty sums of gold. Unlike the complacency of her other family members, minus Thistle, Willow did not support the invasion of Fanewick. She refused to join the School of War wizards in Haven, opting for the School of Knowledge instead, left her castle home, and did her own research on the Serpent’s sickness and the Lady’s Veil. 

While she was away from home, a message from a courier found her, and it informed her of her family had succumb to the Sickness. Willow believed their death was the karma for all the wrong they wrought in life; however, she did feel sorrow that her baby sister was caught in the destruction. It was expected that she would take over the family business, but she declined. Never returning to her home, letting the dust settle in the walls and the trade end, Willow traversed from Haven to Fanewick in search of a long-term cure. During her time alone, only using the power of her name when it would benefit her, she heard rumors that maybe not all of the Blackwoods were dead. Surely, they were just speaking of her…right?

Along the way, she came across a giant, [[PCs/Rizzha\|Rizzha]], who had an uncanny talent of finding the Lady’s Veil. They headed to [[Fanewick Cities & Towns/Qavvik’s Tower\|Qavvik’s Tower]] together, hoping to have success in their studies. One day, when heading to a research lab, they were each delivered a letter. This letter from [[Kriel Dirn\|Kriel Dirn]] mentioned the power of her family name and attempted to entice her with the promise of help in her find a cure. They figured it was worth checking this out and reluctantly headed back to Haven.
