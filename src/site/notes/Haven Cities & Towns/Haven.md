Haven was once the most powerful force in the region; for centuries, the high stone walls into the capital bore the phrase “The Godless Gate.” While the original meaning has been lost to common knowledge, some dusty tomes and ancient records state that the founders of Haven wished to be free of the influence of the Faint Divinities that dominated the surrounding regions. They made their home behind [[Gods & Faint Deities/Shun’Aush the Granite Ophid\|Shun’Aush the Granite Ophid]] remains, which became the mighty walls that Haven is known for.

Over the last two years, over half of Haven’s populace fell to a disease known as the Serpent’s Sickeness, filing Haven with statues of victims in their last moments of agony.

## Layout
The city is divided into three tiers. Entering the city, to the right and left are numerous taverns and inns for travelers. Behind these businesses are the homes of many of the lower class. Into the second tier, there are middle class homes, taverns, shops, and an open air market. Beyond this in the third tier is the opulent district where many of the governance buildings reside and those who hold great wealth. Center stage is the Council Hall, and on either side and wrapping around the Council Hall is the College of War Wizards School and the Haven Army Headquarters. This area holds the most green space in the city and is extraordinarily well maintained.

**The Crooked Bell**: An old tavern that is topped with a small bell tower that is slightly leaning. Locals believe that it tolls whenever the Serpent’s Sickness takes another. This is where the adventuring group encountered Talia in [[Session Story/Session 1\|Session 1]]. She pretended to be drunk in an attempt to gather information for the Fanewraith, [[Cirelle\|Cirelle]], but failed.

**The Raven’s Hearth**: A quiet inn found in the second tier of the city where the fire never seems to die. Rooms are plain but it’s safe.

**Essek’s Curious Curations**: Run by an elf named [[Notable Figures/Haven NPCs/Essek\|Essek]], this shop is a vibrant smelling apothecary. There is a wide array of potions and magical items. 

**Reddan’s Forge**: This is a blacksmith in the second tier not far from the open air market that sharpens both farming tools and swords. Armor is also available here.

**The Quiet Loom**: A weaver’s shop that produces simple cloth and fine silks alike. Occasionally, they house some magical attire specific to magic casters.

**The Veiled Hall**: Command center for [[Kriel Dirn\|Kriel Dirn]], The Veiled Hall is the spy’s guild hall in Haven. It is across from the Council Hall in the third tier. The outside is decorated in lavish reds, golds, and blacks, but the curtains in the windows always stay drawn closed. Inside the main room is filled with tables covered in papers, maps, and books. The walls are lined with bookshelves, and spies all dressed in dark robes enter and exit throughout the day and night. Kriel’s office is plain yet ornate, making no mistake to denote who is in charge.

**Council Hall**: This is where the leadership of Haven gather and do business. It is a tall tower of extreme opulence, glass, blues, and gold that match the ghostly ophid that looms overhead. Each official has their own office as the staircase spiral upward, which includes [[Notable Figures/Haven NPCs/Archmage Phylax\|Archmage Phylax]], [[Notable Figures/Haven NPCs/Emissary Trezan\|Emissary Trezan]], [[Notable Figures/Haven NPCs/Warlord Vaurn\|Warlord Vaurn]], and [[Notable Figures/Haven NPCs/Emperor Niclis Ilineiros\|Emperor Niclis Ilineiros]].

**Temple of the Lady’s Veil**: Though this is a godless city, a temple was erected meant to pay tribute to those taken by the Serpent’s Sickness. It is located at the cusp of the second and third tiers. Some go there and secretly pray to the gods and Faint Deities amongst the statues, plants, offerings, and murals of flowers.
