## Thade Ival
Thade is the face of the Reapers but operates in the shadows of [[Haven Cities & Towns/Fire Falls\|Fire Falls]], staying inconspicuous within [[Haven Cities & Towns/Haven\|Haven]] boundaries. This position gives him ease to send out Reapers into Fanewick and intercept faeries coming to and from Alula, keeping track of the Fanewraith’s plans. He is principled but affable with the goal to draw more to the Reapers’ cause. In order to recruit others, this Katari Seraph downplays the group’s less savory tactics and drives home the need for balance in a world of chaos caused by human folly.

## Balor Rosten
This halfling ranger is Thade’s right hand and acts as captain when sending out cells of Reapers. Deft at navigating the [[Fanewick Cities & Towns/Carnivorous Divide\|Carnivorous Divide]], Balor uses his skills to sabotage Haven forces.

## Istra Vale
Istra is a Fungril that is unnervingly serene. She believes that she knows what targets should have been culled naturally, receiving supposed visions of [[Gods & Faint Deities/Great Owl Nikta\|Great Owl Nikta]]’s judgement, so she travels between cells throughout Fanewick and Haven bringing rightful ends where needed. Istra believes that Havenites deserve the Serpent’s Sickness for paving over death and seeking expansion, denying entropy.
