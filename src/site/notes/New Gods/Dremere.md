The God of Midnight, manipulation, breaking boundaries, obfuscation, shadows, and obscuring weaknesses. His symbol is a raven.

Using [[Forgotten Gods/Kasra\|Kasra]]’s own feats against him, Dremere was able to trick and overcome him during the Divine War. Before Kasra’s banishment, the two created the Faint Deity [[Faint Deities/Oove\|Oove]], a watcher in the night with the capability to both aid and trick travelers.
