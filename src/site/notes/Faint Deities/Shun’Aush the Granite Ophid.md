Shun’Aush the Granite Ophid was a Faint Divinity in Fanewick. As the name suggests, his animal form was known to be a monstrously large granite snake, scales like gray stone. Ushering in the cycles of life, death, and rebirth, he was seen traversing Fanewick regularly, and no one dared disrupt his path.

For centuries, his closest friend was the [[Faint Deities/Great Owl Nikta\|Great Owl Nikta]]. The two of them understood the importance of the delicate balance they maintained. While Shun’Aush oversaw life, death, and rebirth, Nikta brought seasons to those in Fanewick, a different form of a life, death, and rebirth in nature. While the importance of his role was not denied by those in Fanewick, it did not stop the damning of his existence, as it was normal for people to not want to lose those they loved.

Shun’Aush also made his presence available for those performing the [[Creation of Clanks/Consecration of Vessels\|Consecration of Vessels]] as a form of rebirth. He would protect the area of the ritual with his spiritual energy, circling as an ophid, and in his human form, he would bless the clank with a unique rune. Since his death, new clanks do not have this mark.

Wicklings respected the need for this Faint Divinity, as they do all Faint Deities, but Havenites believed themselves above Faint Deities. For centuries the gate above [[Haven Cities & Towns/Haven\|Haven]] bore the phrase “The Godless Gate.” Wishing to be free of their control, Haven planned to defeat the mightiest of the Faint Divinity, Shun’Aush. Centuries ago, Emperor Sylith Aerenor and Archmage Torren Blackwell, created their attack strategy, and though their method of deicide has been lost to time, their victory is ever-evident as the remains the Granite Ophid reinforced the walls of Haven. A timeless spectral visage loomed over Haven like a warning to any other deities who even think to challenge the city.

While the Ophid’s bones wrap around the city, his stone scales remained untouched for centuries, but when the city sought more growth and progress, the tilling went deeper into the soil and disrupted the stone. Ash and dust kicked up, and it resulted in the Serpent’s Sickness ravaging the city — Shun’Anush’s revenge many years later. Most Havenites believe this to be his revenge, even centuries later, and to this day seek a permanent cure.

The passing of the Granite Ophid has impacted Fanewick, as well. The Consecration of Vessels takes longer to complete without the direct aid of the most powerful Divinity in the Mortal Realm. His spiritual energy used to help usher in a soul for rebirth, but now, without him, the leaders in the Consecration must rely on their meditations alone.
