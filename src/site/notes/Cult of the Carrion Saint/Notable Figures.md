## Sister Dubois
Sister Dubois is a soft-spoken human woman who eagerly finds sympathetic souls to teach about their Saint Carrion. She is the outward face of the Cult and uses her welcoming presence to make the organization appealing to outsiders. Once new members go through the Rite of Dreams with Father Carrask, her demeanor shifts to one of a strict zealot that demands orders be followed to bring forth the awakening of their Saint.

## Father Carrask
Though not the main face of the Cult, Father Carrask is the de facto leader alongside Sister Dubois. Deep in Fanewick in the [[Fanewick Cities & Towns/Unsleeping Woods\|Unsleeping Woods]], Father Carrask runs the Rite of Dreams, leading new members through their fever dreams to find the Carrion Saint. This giant is clad in tattered robes and stitched shrouds from withered victims. It is believed that he speaks directly to the Saint. Carrask gives off an air or wisdom mixed with a stern quietness.

## Raskil the Hollow
Raskil, an Infernis with deep purple skin and red eyes, is a zealot feared among even believers. He is covered in scars, some of which may be self-inflicted. Raskil believes true devotion requires one to be emptied of all that is not the Saint. Being taken by the withered and reborn should be viewed as an honor, not feared, and he is one who leads followers in dangerous and visceral rituals.
