Though the elevated city of Stolen Fen is in Fanewick territory, Haven technically owns the colony after the capture of [[Faint Deities/Great Owl Nikta\|Great Owl Nikta]]’s Reaping Eye in order to control the flower fields below. This is also the case for the colony of [[Fanewick Cities & Towns/Qavvik’s Tower\|Qavvik’s Tower]]. Unlike Qavvik’s Tower, however, the Stolen Fen was not maintained as well, thus, leaving it to fall into a state of squalor. The small city is now occupied by many of the unsavory and unscrupulous variety, such as rogues, thieves, and peasants. It’s the perfect location for those seeking to get out of the eye of Haven while still having protection from the Witherwild and a potential job in the fields.

- The Oxblood Mug – Named after the large ox creatures that roam the Riverwalker’s Hunting Grounds. Known for its thick, bitter ale and hearty stews, this tavern attracts shady individuals and those who farm the flower fields. The owner displays a rack of cracked mugs as trophies from brawls.
- The Copper Cask – Tavern and inn with a patchy roof, now frequented by locals of the Stolen Fen more than outsiders.
- The Fen Runner’s Rest – A sagging inn for smugglers and wanderers,  it offers safe (if not clean) beds.
- Harlvik’s Curios & Salvage – A shop selling trinkets, scavenged relics, and suspicious “antiquities” looted from the Witherwild corrupted woods.
- The House of the Hallowed – A decrepit temple with half-broken idols of Faint Deities. Its priests offer blessings for coin, but rumor says they sell secrets to others for even more coin
