Orielle Stonehelm is a six foot tall half-orc that found herself in the [[World Information/Haven Army\|Haven Army]], making her an Orderborne Stalwart Guardian. Her skin is a blue hue, and her stocky build is scarred from years of battles and training. Some of the notable scars would be the one that runs over her eyebrow and down to her chin, a deep scar on the top of her arm, and one starting from her collarbone and down to her chest. She sports dark, black hair styled into a short mohawk, one of her tusks has a silver cap.

Ori was born and raised in [[Haven Cities & Towns/Haven\|Haven]]. She quickly developed skill for battle and joined the army quite young. When the Serpent’s Sickness took hold of Haven, Ori’s caretaker demeanor emerged. Her mother, NAME, wanted to heal those afflicted, and her father, NAME, supported the invasion of Fanewick. Ori found herself wanting to help her mother but also, not wanting to let down her father. She followed orders and went with the army in the invasion. It is to be noted that she was not in the party with [[Notable Figures/Haven NPCs/Archmage Phylax\|Archmage Phylax]] that went directly to steal the eye from the [[Gods & Faint Deities/Great Owl Nikta\|Great Owl Nikta]].

Upon her return to Haven, she found both of her parents succumbed to the Sickness. Filled with grief and rage, she focused all of her attention to her service in the Army. She became a strong soldier with a resoluteness to protect her brothers and sisters.

After the invasion and the retrieval of the eye, some squads were still sent into Fanewick to keep the Witherwild at bay and the truth of the damage away from [[Haven Cities & Towns/Haven\|Haven]] eyes. One day, Orielle’s party was ambushed by withered creatures. On the defensive, her team was picked off, and Ori was the sole survivor, defeating the creatures. Her brother-in-arms, NAME, handed her a key, but when she asked what it was to, he passed in her arms. 

Bloodied and hurt herself, she trudged through the woods a bit before collapsing. A group of Wicklings found her. They were from [[Fanewick Cities & Towns/The Stones of Cassema\|The Stones of Cassema]] and brought her to their settlement, giving her the aid she required. Shocked by their kindness and generosity, she asked the leader, [[Aenwyn\|Aenwyn]], if she could stay and protect and help them. To her surprise, Aenwyn happily agreed and welcomed her into their home. The way they accepted her made her begin to regret her time in the Army when she pushed Wicklings out of their safe homes and settlements in conquest for the eye and a cure for the Sickness, which didn’t even save her parents in the end. Each day that passed in this new home felt easier, but she was still silently plagued by the loss of her family and the trauma of losing her soldiers.

Ori often scouted with those from the Stones. There was a day out in the woods where she came across a damaged clank being attacked by a withered beast. Without hesitation, she stepped in, killed the creature, and saved him. The clank claimed to not know his name or really any of his past. Feeling curiosity, sorrow, and an odd connection to this Druid clank, Ori suggested he come back to the Stones of Cassema with her. Aenwyn allowed the inclusion, and the two became close companions. Eventually Ori gave him the name [[PCs/Caelum\|Caelum]], and, in return, he gave her a protective warding necklace for saving his life.

When Ori received the letter from [[Kriel Dirn\|Kriel Dirn]], she was hesitant to accept and sought Caelum’s advice. He told her it seemed important and that she should go back to Haven. She couldn’t imagine going about this without her friend at her side, and Caelum quickly agreed to join her. On this adventure, she must grapple with the weight of responsibility, a tormenting past of pain, and hopefully find a use for the key she was left with on that life changing expedition.
