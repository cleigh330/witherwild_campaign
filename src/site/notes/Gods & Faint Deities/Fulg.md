Fulg, the Stacker of Stones, is a small god who favors tribute in the form of smooth, stacked river rocks. Under his power, bivalves and limpets grow abundantly on rocks where they can be easily harvested. When not in his human body, it is said that he takes the form of a large turtle, traversing between the settlements that pay him worship.

Many communities by the coast and rivers in Fanewick leave tribute to Fulg, though his influence has found its way into few settlements inland. One of these is [[Fanewick Cities & Towns/The Stones of Cassema\|The Stones of Cassema]]. The people there stack stones around the protruding stone columns that jut from the ground. There is a belief that thanks to this tribute Fulg keeps them safe from the Witherwild, but the guards and scouts in that camp quietly know theyâ€™re the ones providing protection.
