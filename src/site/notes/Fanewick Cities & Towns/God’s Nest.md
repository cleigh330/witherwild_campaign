God’s Nest is the large pine tree in the forest between the Cackling Wood and Unsleeping Wood. The point of the tree is said to reach the clouds. Not only is this the tallest tree in Fanewick but, it’s also the oldest, said to date back to when the [[Forgotten Gods\|Forgotten Gods]] and [[New Gods\|New Gods]] roamed the Mortal Plane.

Many speculate that God’s Nest is where the Faint Deities come to rest in their animal forms. According to [[Cirelle\|Cirelle]]’s scouts, they believe God’s Nest is the last place where the [[Faint Deities/Great Owl Nikta\|Great Owl Nikta]] was seen, and so, Cirelle is on her way there and is set to meet the group of adventurer’s there.
