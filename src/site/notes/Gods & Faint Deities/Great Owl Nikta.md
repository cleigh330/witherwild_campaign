The Great Owl Nikta is one of the Faint Divinities that resides in Fanewick. As the name suggests, it is known that her animal form is a giant owl. The other synonymous name for her is the Shepherd of Seasons. Her Reaping Eye brings winter, and her Sowing Eye brings spring upon the continent. When it is time to switch the seasons, she activates the eye and flys over the land as an owl to shepherd in the change from abundance and growth to scarcity and lack. It is a crucial balance that Nikta proudly oversees.

Years ago, Nikta used to harmonize a balance with another Faint Divinity, [[Gods & Faint Deities/Shun’Aush the Granite Ophid\|Shun’Aush the Granite Ophid]]. Where Nikta was the stability for seasons, Shun’Aush was the equilibrium of life and death and rebirth. The two were close compatriots, roaming the wilds of Fanewick together and connecting over the push and pull of humans, thanking and praising them to cursing and damning them. It was common for humans to blame them when aspects of life were not in their favor, such as harvest or the passing of a loved one, but those tides would turn come spring growth or with the birth of a new child. All this did not deter them from their duties, as both were wise enough to hold steadfast to maintaining balance. After his passing, Nikta’s warm demeanor as grown rather cold and distant from those she serves.

Unlike her friendship and reciprocated respect with Shun’Aush, Nikta clashed occasionally with [[Gods & Faint Deities/Hyacynis\|Hyacynis]]. Being the one who spreads blossoms, Hyacynis always wanted more growth through Fanewick and harped on the unnecessary length of the reaping season. But, Nikta knowing the necessary cycle must be maintained, she often waves off Hyacynis’s complaints.

After Shun’Aush died and the Serpent’s Sickness came to torment those in [[Haven Cities & Towns/Haven\|Haven]], the plan was hatched by [[Notable Figures/Archmage Phylax\|Archmage Phylax]] to steal Nikta’s Reaping Eye in order to keep the world in a perpetual spring and farm as many of the Lady’s Veil flowers as possible. The [[World Information/Haven Army\|Haven Army]] marched into Fanewick, overpowered Nikta, and used Phylax used magic to take the Reaping Eye. The world was thrown into a never-ending spring, and while they could find more of the Lady’s Veil, the consequence was the Witherwild — rampant overgrowth that turned dangerous for all life in Fanewick.

Angry and bitter at this transgression from humans of the godless city, Nikta became a recluse. She is said to be hiding away somewhere in the Fanewick woods, as the Great Owl form she takes on has not been seen flying over Fanewick for quite some time. Some Wicklings believe that the Withered are gifted their power from Nikta’s wrath to drive Haven forces out of Fanewick and return the Reaping Eye.
