The Reapers of Nikta are a somber, disciplined network of ideologues and warriors who serve the balance once kept by Nikta’s Reaping Eye. Some older members also regard [[Gods & Faint Deities/Shun’Aush the Granite Ophid\|Shun’Aush the Granite Ophid]] as a god of balance and do not agree with his death by the Havenites.

While they do not worship Nikta in a traditional religious sense, they recognize the profound necessity of her role. With the natural cycle of seasons and death disrupted, the Reapers believe the world has tipped too far toward unchecked growth and unnatural survival. In response, they have taken it upon themselves to restore equilibrium by becoming death’s stewards.

Reapers operate in shadow, striking where growth has exceeded its rightful bounds, particularly due to the Witherwild. They wear ash-gray garb and most bear the symbol of a weeping eye to symbolize what was lost. Some cells quietly study the Witherwild to find ways to halt its spread. Others are more pragamatic, attempting to use withered objects and beings as weapons when able and convenient.

Make no mistake, even though they find ways to use the Witherwild to aid their means, the Reapers do not glorify rot or decay. Instead, they revere the necessity of endings. With the natural reaping cycle broken, they see themselves as agents of correction, stepping in where winter no longer comes, where famine no longer prunes, and where death no longer harvests. They act not out of hatred but out of grim purpose:

> If life is left unchecked, it devours all.

Ultimately, their goals are to counterbalance the excesses of unchecked growth and reintroduce loss, hardship, and mortality where they would have once occurred naturally. With these ambitions, they also try to destabilize powers that benefit from the absence of natural endings. It is not uncommon to find Reapers working in small, flexible cells acting independently but with shared philosophies.
