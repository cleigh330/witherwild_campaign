Qui’Gar, known as the Whispered Sweetness for a Thorny End, is a quiet god who presides over the deaths of those who pass in thorny bushes and briar patches. Given the danger from the Witherwild’s corruptive growth, her job has become harder and upended her quiet existence.

In Fanewick, sparrows are often believed to be culturally connected to death. Additionally, sparrows are viewed as harbingers of death and are thought to have a spiritual connection. Because of this, many believe that the sparrows around Fanewick are actually Qui’gar.
