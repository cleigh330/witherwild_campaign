Unlike the [[Creation of Clanks/Consecration of Vessels\|Consecration of Vessels]], the Rite of Convergence is not tied so deeply to spirituality but rather, is inextricably bound to magic. This Rite is performed on the metal and steel clanks from [[Haven Cities & Towns/Haven\|Haven]] by the mages in the city.

In the Rite of Convergence, the dormant body of the clank is taken to the School of Wizards in Haven. There is a specific room dedicated to this ritual. In the center of the room is an arcane circle inscribed with runic symbols. The clank is placed in the center, and when the mages begin their casting, magical ley lines begin to glow around the circle.

High ranking mages, known as Weavers, and the Artificers of the clank are present and actively participating in the Rite, channeling their magical energies into the arcane circle and thus into the gemstone of the clank. Where a stone-like orb holds the soul in the Consecration, it is a gemstone crystal that absorbs the magical, life-shaping energy in the Rite. Some refer to it as a soulstone, but it is not a soul that animates the clank. 

When the magic grows to a sufficient level and takes hold in the gemstone, the clank begins the Awakening Process. The clank’s gemstone glows a deep violet coloration, and the artificer carefully seals the chest cavity, which has the role of the clank etched inside. These roles could include anything from soldier or caregiver to engineer or scout; the possibilities are vast, but the role — or purpose — is always predetermined. When the chest plate is sealed, the glow begins to emanate through the clank’s “veins” until it reaches the eyes.

A consciousness is awakened in the clank “born” by the Rite, but it is not the same understanding as a “soul.” Instead, this consciousness is a patchwork constructed from the magical weave. It is said that the clanks even have a sense of the experiences from the Weavers involved in the process, adding to the clank’s “essence.” In some cases, Weavers or Artificers may choose to imbue the clank with certain traits or memories in order to impart their own personal philosophies onto the clank. In this way, they are more malleable than those born of the Consecration and more susceptible to the corruption of man. When clanks are given this type of added consciousness, they may “remember” their Weaver’s  ideals, feelings, or memories, but these are not fully realized as their own and may manifest in strange ways.
