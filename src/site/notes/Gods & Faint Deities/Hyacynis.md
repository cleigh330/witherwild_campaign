Hyacynis, They Who Spread Small Blossoms, is a friend of bees and tiny flowers who has embraced the Witherwild after seeing their influence and domain swell (literally) to immense proportions.

To traverse swiftly around Fanewick to reach various gardens and rich areas of fauna, it is said that Hyacynis turns into a deer whose antlers are decorated in flowers. Those who worship this Faint Deity have given crowns of flowers to the friendly deer in Fanewick; however, due to the Witherwild, the animals have become vicious, even those once docile, so the gifts of flowers are no longer able to be given. Hyacynis does not seem to be bothered by this lack of tribute though. They are very much enjoying the rampant growth brought on by the Witherwild.
