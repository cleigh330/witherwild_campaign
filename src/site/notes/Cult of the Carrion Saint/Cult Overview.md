The Cult of the Carrion Saint is an emerging faith born in the wake of [[Faint Deities/Great Owl Nikta\|Great Owl Nikta]]’s Reaping Eye being stolen. Since the emergence of the Witherwild, individuals scattered across Fanewick began to receive haunting visions: a foundling god of unraveling flesh into sacred decay and carrion birds heralding a new order. Though each vision was slightly varied, they shared a single revelation: the ichor that seeps from withered beings is divine, and it feeds something vast and growing beneath the surface — a Faint Deity gestating into goodhood.

Adherents believe that by accelerating this decay, they will hasten the birth of their god, the Carrion Saint. To them, death is not a tragedy but a sacrement, and they often don skull masks, particularly those of vultures, crows, and other scavengers, to signify their role as messengers of sacred rot. Their rituals are often visceral and grotesque, involving bloodletting, sacrifice, or the spreading of ichor-tainted flesh.

The cult believes that the world is already dying, and that only through decay can it be reborn. They do not seek to end the Witherwild, but to nurture it — feed it, guide it, and eventually, merge with their Saint when she awakens. The more the world embraces the Witherwild and the rotting mutation it brings, the stronger their god becomes. Their faith is born of desperation and hope, twisted into something both tragic and terrifying.

Their goals are to continue to grow the Carrion Saint through the spread of the Witherwild and decay. They aim to disrupt any attempts to end the Witherwild and reestablish old balance. To grow their following, they lure new members to new holy sites and use corrupt relics and carriers to bring on fever dreams.
