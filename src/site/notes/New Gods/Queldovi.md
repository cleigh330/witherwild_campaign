The Goddess of Grace, love, storytelling, and the influence of beauty. Her symbol is a mosaic hand-mirror, which she reclaimed from [[Forgotten Gods/Ilustril\|Ilustril]] to show her power in her position as a New God post-Divine War.

Queldovi created the Faint Deity [[Faint Deities/Ikla\|Ikla]], but they are far more lazy than she anticipated, only waking to beautifully paint the sky before resting and seeking to be left unbothered once more. Being less than pleased with their demeanor, Queldovi then created [[Faint Deities/Hyacynis\|Hyacynis]], who is flourishing in the Witherwild.
