Ikla is known as the Sky Painter. Their artistic prowess and talent are unmatched, painting the skies of each weekly sunrise and sunset over Fanewick in a myriad of scintillating colors. They could not be lazier the rest of the week, and their demeanor is exceedingly unpleasant, offended that anyone would ask a favor of them during their time off. Due to this particular characteristic, many believe Ikla takes the form of a sloth during the week to avoid any contact with humans, staying high up in the trees.

Given the week of day and night cycle, those that provide worship to Ikla do so by waking up in the early morning in time to watch the sunrise for the week and gather again at the end of the week to marvel in the sunset. While [[Haven Cities & Towns/Haven\|Haven]] is known as the “godless city,” there are some citizens that sneak out to the outskirts to watch the sunrise and sunset, as well.
