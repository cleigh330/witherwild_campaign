## Mortal Realm
The Mortal Realm consists of the land, sea, and sky where mortals live out the entirety of their lives. This realm was created by the [[Forgotten Gods\|Forgotten Gods]] during the Earliest Age. The Forgotten Gods were immortals that traveled between the Hallows Above and this new plane as easily as waking from a dream. When t he Forgotten Gods were overthrown by the [[New Gods\|New Gods]], many deities were trapped in this plane eternally. Currently, the Mortal Realm is occupied by the Faint Divinities, which are lesser deities created by both the Forgotten and New Gods, and they greatly influence the lives of mortals.

## The Hallows Above
The Hallows Above are a collection of deific territories that once belonged to the Forgotten Gods before the New Gods claimed it at the end of the Earliest Age. The Gods in this realm can speak with those in the Mortal Realm without leaving this domain, but the communication is strange and obfuscated. The New Gods want to keep the Forgotten Gods out of this place because they do not want them to try to rise again.

## The Circles Below
This is the collection of lower realms where many of the Forgotten Gods were banished. These “Fallen Gods” of the Forgotten lost the Divine War with the New Gods and are now deemed “evil practitioners of tainted magic” and referred to as “demons.” The Circles Below are viewed as a place of corruption, destruction, and violence and home to some of the most dangerous creatures. In the Mortal Realm, arcane magic can create a temporary rift between the two planes, which allows the Fallen to pass through.
