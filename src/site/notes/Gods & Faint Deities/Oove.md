Oove is the Watcher of the Night Bloom, and he is one of the few local gods who has never been seen. But, he is often heard in the wilds at night, whispering directions to lost travelers, pointing them to the nearest source of night bloom, which helps guides those traveling during the week of night. Locals claim he leads those who displease him or harm nocturnal creatures into dangerous terrain. Itâ€™s rumored that he watches over Fanewick nights from his home on the moon. Even though this is the predominant rumor, some believe he could have an animal form of a bat, flying through the night sky.

He is worshiped in [[Fanewick Cities & Towns/Alula\|Alula]]. Those wishing to pay tribute go to the Moonveil, which is a monastery in the treetop village.  Inside Moonveil, overseen by the Fungril [[Brennok\|Brennok]], visitors leave money, flowers, and carvings. Throughout the day, the people of Alula pop in and out to pray and ask for guidance.

[[PCs/Ashkansi\|Ashkansi]] and [[PCs/Rizzha\|Rizzha]] are worshippers of Oove, and after their visit to Alula, [[PCs/Koraxys\|Koraxys]] considered looking to Oove for guidance, as well.
