Alula is a treetop village in Fanewick. This is the base of [[Cirelle\|Cirelle]], also known as the Fanewraith, who [[Kriel Dirn\|Kriel Dirn]] sent the adventuring party was sent out to find. The treetop village is home to a large number of druids, rangers, and rogues, and the ancestries are largely elf, human, clank, faerie, fungril, and simiah. 

## Layout
The treetop village is situated in a crescent shape, and in the center is a grassy opening. Hanging above this opening held aloft by many vines is a lantern lamplight. To most, the Lamplight gives off a pale blue glow to the surrounding treetops, but to those with an ancestry intrinsically tied to nature, such as fungril or simiah, they see iridescent glowing waves emanating from the lamplight. Thanks to this strange device, Alula is untouched by the Witherwild. Residents are unsure how this strange magic works, but Cirelle did tell the group that the lantern was given to them by a Ribbet that was passing through the town. When approaching Alula, [[PCs/Koraxys\|Koraxys]] and [[PCs/Caelum\|Caelum]] both saw the iridescent glow from it rippling out through the trees.

Those who do not have a means to fly or druid craft vines can access to treetops by the large, hollowed tree trunk that has stairs carved into the inside that spiral up. There are bridges and vines that connect the sections of platforms and buildings, making it easy to navigate around, though it is still advised to always watch your step. Lanterns are lit throughout the community, but none give off the same magical glow as the Lamplight.

**The Hollow Branch**: Tavern & Inn carved into a giant hollowed limb. Inside, it is a relatively lavish tavern frequented by many fae and elves, giving it a decor and architecture that melds the two communities. This is the Inn that Cirelle offered the group rooms.

**The Ashvine Cup**: This is a rickety tavern whose main guests are Druids and rangers. Inside, it is common to see many of them repairing or crafting weapons and armor or tracking on maps all while enjoying a pint. 

**Glimmerleaf Exchange**: A high-end trading post where locals barter. It includes pelts, salves, silks, and unique items but generally at a higher cost to outsiders passing through, which is a rarity these days. Run by an elf named Camort.

**Eryth’s Poultices & Charms**: An apothecary that houses potions and magical items. It is run by an older faerie named Eryth. Fae tend to get a better deal here more easily.

**Tonne’s Leatherworks**: Given the location, traditional black smithing is not a luxury afforded to those in Alula, but they do still have a leatherworks shop that provides them with light and medium armors and simple weapons. Adriack Tonne, an older half-orc, is in charge of the forge.

**Canopy Clinic**: A healing hall tended by herbalists and druids. The air smells of herbs and damp moss.

**Nightbloom Mission**: A temple dedicated to Oove, though other deities can be worshiped there. [[Brennok\|Brennok]], a Fungril, is the one who runs this temple.

**The Verdant Spire**: A hopeful name that is the house to where the Fanewraith conducts business. Inside, it is not a traditional office. The main area looks like a simple bar, and aside from a bookcase and documents along the opposite wall, one may not even realize this is a place of Fanewraith business. In the back of the building is Cirelle’s living and sleeping quarters.
