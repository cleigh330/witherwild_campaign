Ashkansi Stabbitha goes by Ash for short. She is a half-elf Syndicate Rogue from the Slyborne community. Ash has a thin build, dark hair, brown eyes, and sand colored skin. She typically dresses in dark clothing to mask herself in shadows.

Formerly, she lived in [[Haven Cities & Towns/Haven\|Haven]] and had dealings amongst thieve’s guilds and some work with those of the [[Veiled Hall\|Veiled Hall]], but she was caught operating in a thieve’s guild and forced into exile as punishment. While the punishment seemed more than sufficient to fit the crime, there was someone still in Haven that hunted her, and when they couldn’t get to her, they took her family’s lives as collateral. Whether the hunt for her is still ongoing is unknown to Ashkansi.

Due to her past struggles in the city, she grew to believe Haven and the [[World Information/Haven Army\|Haven Army]] to be corrupt and unjust. She headed out to a settlement adjacent to Haven but located in Fanewick called [[Fanewick Cities & Towns/Stolen Fen\|Stolen Fen]]. It was here that she was hired by someone of the [[Blackwood Family\|Blackwood Family]] to assassinate an Infernis-Fungril named [[PCs/Koraxys\|Koraxys]], a member of the rival [[Kelador Family\|Kelador Family]]. Almost going through with the deed, Koraxys was able to dissuade Ash with a hefty sum of gold.

Ash became a cautious acquaintance with Koraxys. One day, however, she witnessed Koraxys practicing some sort of magic that related closely to death and believes the Infernis-Fungril to be a necromancer, leading her caution of Koraxys grew.

With Ash on guard, [[Kriel Dirn\|Kriel Dirn]], the Spymaster of Haven, used this to employ Ash to keep an eye on Koraxys. He later sent a letter to both of them to enlist them in a job that would set them and a group of adventurers on a journey that could change the fate of Haven and Fanewick forever. She has to decide whether she is willing to be a team player in a new group of acquaintances or stay as a self-serving rogue.
