This town was always one that’s quiet and self-sufficient on harvesting, farming, lumber, and stonework. It has always been a settlement that did well with manual labor and trading goods. When the Lady’s Veil became the most important commodity for Havenites, those in Keener’s Pike shifted to farming for the red flower. 

Within the walls of Keener’s Pike, the demographic ranges, but the majority are giants, humans, elves, and Infernis. This is generally a place where workers retire after a long day on the job, and fewer guards are posted here than other settlements in [[Haven Cities & Towns/Haven\|Haven]]. 

## Layout
**The Grindstone:** Built inside an old water mill, the Grindstone’s circular bar surrounds the establishment’s large, rotating namesake, which crushes various plants to make juices to add to drinks. After long days of work, patrons seat themselves closest to whichever flavor they prefer and wait for Zane Krimordun, the Infernis bartender, to open an sluice and serve them.

**The Lumber Mill:** With the Witherwild, The Lumber Mill has been busier than ever. Many of the workers try to cut down the trees along the [[Fanewick Cities & Towns/Carnivorous Divide\|Carnivorous Divide]] before it’s set on fire weekly that keeps the border under control. This shop is now in the care of an elf named Cassius.

**The Cheerful Goat:** Named after owner Burt Birch’s pet goat, Margot, The Cheerful Goat is the main general store in Keener’s Pike. Inside, the shop smells of hay and herbs, and customers can be goods like food, potions, general supplies, and, of course, goat cheese and milk.

**Temple of the Giants:** Given the large giant population in Keener’s Pike, this modest chamber is dedicated to the history of giants and worship of an ancient giant forgotten god. Though human worship is rare, some turn to this forgotten god in these times of strife, requesting strength, endurance, and constitution. This temple is run by a giant, Bokeem Elbore.

**Guild of Growth:** Comprised of farmers, the Guild of Growth ensures fair rates for goods sold, dictates elements of production to prevent waste, and communicates strategy for managing threats of the Witherwild. They’re a crucial part of this community.
