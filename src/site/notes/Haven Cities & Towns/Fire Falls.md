This was once a prosperous city amongst trade routes, but Fire Falls is now a penurious city in [[Haven Cities & Towns/Haven\|Haven]]’s boundaries that receives much of the run off from the city proper. Since the invasion of Fanewick and the stealing of [[Gods & Faint Deities/Great Owl Nikta\|Great Owl Nikta]]’s Reaping Eye, they rely heavily on farming Lady’s Veil and trade with [[Haven Cities & Towns/Keener’s Pike\|Keener’s Pike]]. Fire Falls was once called Washburne Hold, but now that many of the Wizards, Sorcerers, and Rangers here help set blaze to the [[Fanewick Cities & Towns/Carnivorous Divide\|Carnivorous Divide]], the name changed to reflect the work done by many of these citizens. In secret, some faeries have started trading with Alula, using their ability to fly to go over the cliffs and avoid the Witherwild.

A group known as the [[Reapers of Nikta/Reapers of Nikta\|Reapers of Nikta]] have used this town’s proximity to the border to their advantage. They send cells in and out of Haven territory and into Fanewick with ease, and they use the in and outgoing faeries to keep tabs on the movements of the Fanewraith, [[Cirelle\|Cirelle]].

## Layout
Citizens can navigate Fire Falls through the many bridges that connection various sectors of the city over the Ikiria River that splits it down the middle. Stores, inns, taverns, and guild halls are spread throughout the city. The Reapers of Nikta have their hideout conspicuously located in the basement of one of the local businesses.

**Orontithwen:** A tavern in one of the corner spires of the town close to the waterfall and cliffs. The large windows give the perfect bird’s eye view of the cliffs and forest beyond Fire Fall’s walls. A winding staircase leads to upper levels that contain not only tables for patrons but also, hammocks. Faeries and Simiah do well with attending to guests on higher levels.

**Abraham’s Alchemies:** Abraham is a halfling alchemist, and he runs this little shop on the east side of town. His storefront is often a mess, but he is undeniably skilled at his craft.

**The Blade and the Flame:** This blacksmith shop is run by a small team of humans and dwarves. Though times are hard, they strive to create the best possible weapons and armor with what they have available. There is a beauty and skill undoubtedly in every piece crafted here, and the price reflects as much, especially when the work is done by chief smith Becklossen.

**The Folded Page:** This is one of the premier…and only…bookshops in Fire Falls. From the arcane to mundane texts, readers can find an array of works, and the bookkeep, Fodrick More, is happy to assist. 

**The Saintfire Tower:** In the spire opposite Orontithwen lies the Saintfire Tower. Haven is known as the godless city, and since Fire Falls is in their bounds, they are meant to follow the same; however, some have begun. To use Saintfire Tower as their own place of worship for any of the Faint Deities. The inside is ramshackle, as many still following Haven’s rule don’t bother to upkeep, which gives the appearance of its disuse. It is not uncommon to see small shrines built from small knickknacks and little flames lighting the windows of the spire. Half-Elf Keeper Lavithel tends to the sporadic guests and assures Haven guards that it is only worship to end the Serpent’s Sickness, much like the Temple of the Lady’s Veil in Haven.
