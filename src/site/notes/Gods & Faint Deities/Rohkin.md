Rohkin, the Wandering Horn, watches over the many herds of horned creatures that reside in Fanewick. In happier times, he preserved the balance of nature and civilization, preventing overhunting. However, since the corruption of the Witherwild took hold, he’s seen his herds change into unrecognizable, dangerous beats.

Rohkin is often found in the [[Fanewick Cities & Towns/Riverwalker’s Hunting Ground\|Riverwalker’s Hunting Ground]], and worshippers claim him to be a ram that wanders the plains.
