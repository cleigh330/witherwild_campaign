The Isle of the Twelve though in [[Haven Cities & Towns/Haven\|Haven]] bounds used to be roamed freely by Wicklings centuries ago. Since Haven invaded Fanewick, Wicklings have left the coast and five islands vacant. Rumor is that during the weeks of night, citizens of Seagloam make the trek in secret to the coast of the Isle that revered the gods.

Centuries ago, the god of the seas, Nerava, was defeated by the New Gods just off the coast of Haven territory. Legend is that his hand broke away pieces of the coast, leaving the smattering of islands there. Before the split of Fanewick and Haven, Wicklings followed [[Faint Deities/Fulg\|Fulg]] there and paid respects to the Old and Forgotten Gods. The coast was splayed with huts of stone, clay, and thatch where many stayed to worship. They forged ships and headed to the islands to establish shrines for the twelve Old Gods. However, when Haven defeated [[Faint Deities/Shun’Aush the Granite Ophid\|Shun’Aush the Granite Ophid]], it was as though the sea around the Isle grew rough and perilous, so the area has been mostly abandoned. Only large ships from Seagloam are suspected to make the journey.
