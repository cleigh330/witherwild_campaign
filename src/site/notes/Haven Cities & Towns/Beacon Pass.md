This area is an extension of the city proper. Many who travel to Haven stop here first for rest at one of the numerous inns and taverns.

In addition to the travelers, which has slowed since the invasion of Fanewick, there is a large number of [[World Information/Haven Army\|Haven Army]] soldiers that stay here. During their shifts, they are posted amongst the fields, trade routes, and [[Fanewick Cities & Towns/Carnivorous Divide\|Carnivorous Divide]].

## Layout
Large walls surround this post with watchtowers on each corner of the square construction. There is one gate entering Beacon Pass from the border between [[Haven Cities & Towns/Haven\|Haven]] and Fanewick and one gate that leads out to the main city, giving it a fortified first stand.

**The Bone Market:** Tucked away under the tower on the back left side is the Bone Market. This operates as a black market for scavenged relics, armor, and dubious medicine outsourced from Fanewick. It is run by a seedy Faun named Harosin.

**The Drunken Pike:** This is a tavern favored by sell-swords, mercenaries, and the Haven Army.

**The Road’s End:** In the heart of Beacon Pass is this sprawling inn known for its clean beds and delicious food. This inn is busy with merchants and travelers rather than army.

**The Watchfire Rest:** Named for the signal fire that lights when it is time to set flame to the Carnivorous Divide, this inn caters to scouts, travelers, and traders. During the week of night, this inn becomes a frequent of workers of the night.

**Wayfarer’s Provisions:** This is a general goods shop that is stocked with road-ready food, tents, rope, and gear for travelers preparing from Haven’s gates out to Fanewick.

**Warden & Sons Armory:** Haven’s Army receive maintenance for their weapons and armor from these blacksmiths. There is also a small stock of reliable blades and shields.

**The Beacon Keep:** Haven Army officers bring those they arrest to this stone keep. It is minimal in its accommodations for prisoners and best to be avoided. 

**The Soldier’s Fountain:**  In the center of Beacon Pass is the Soldier’s Fountain. Members of the army and travelers alike fill up their casks before heading out. It’s also not uncommon to find the formative soldier statues defaced in some fashion.
