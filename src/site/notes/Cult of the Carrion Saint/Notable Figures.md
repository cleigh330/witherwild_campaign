## Father Carrask
Father Carrask is a soft-spoken giant who eagerly finds sympathetic souls to teach about their Saint Carrion. He is the outward face of the Cult and uses his welcoming presence to make the organization appealing to outsiders. Once new members go through the Rite of Dreams with Sister Vorona, his demeanor shifts to one of a strict zealot that demands orders be followed to bring forth the awakening of their Saint.

## Sister Vorona
Though not the main face of the Cult, Sister Vorona is the de facto leader alongside Father Carrask. Deep in Fanewick in the [[Fanewick Cities & Towns/Unsleeping Woods\|Unsleeping Woods]], Sister Vorona runs the Rite of Dreams, leading new members through their fever dreams to find the Carrion Saint. This human woman is clad in tattered robes and stitched shrouds from withered victims. It is believed that she speaks directly to the Saint. Vorona gives off an air of stern and crazed quietness.

## Raskil the Hollow
Raskil, an Infernis with deep purple skin and red eyes, is a zealot feared among even believers. He is covered in scars, some of which may be self-inflicted. Raskil believes true devotion requires one to be emptied of all that is not the Saint. Being taken by the withered and reborn should be viewed as an honor, not feared, and he is one who leads followers in dangerous and visceral rituals.
