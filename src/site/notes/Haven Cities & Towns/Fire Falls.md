This was once a prosperous city amongst trade routes, but Fire Falls is now a penurious city in [[Haven Cities & Towns/Haven\|Haven]]’s boundaries that receives much of the run off from the city proper. Since the invasion of Fanewick and the stealing of [[Gods & Faint Deities/Great Owl Nikta\|Great Owl Nikta]]’s Reaping Eye, they rely heavily on farming Lady’s Veil and trade with [[Haven Cities & Towns/Keener’s Pike\|Keener’s Pike]]. Fire Falls was once called Washburne Hold, but now that many of the Wizards, Sorcerers, and Rangers here help set blaze to the [[Fanewick Cities & Towns/Carnivorous Divide\|Carnivorous Divide]], the name changed to reflect the work done by many of these citizens. In secret, some faeries have started trading with Alula, using their ability to fly to go over the cliffs and avoid the Witherwild.
