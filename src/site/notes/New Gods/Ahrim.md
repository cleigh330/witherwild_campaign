The God of bone, ritual combat, connection of body and spirit, and deciding the fates of the dead based on their path in life. His symbol is an eye in the palm of a skeletal hand.

Ahrim made [[Faint Deities/Qui’Gar\|Qui’Gar]] to keep an eye on those in the mortal plane and do his bidding. With the Witherwild, Qui’Gar has attempted to reach out to Ahrim for assistance.
